Hi, I am **Alfred D'Souza**.

Started out as a computer teacher. Moved on to working as Tech Support agent / Subject Matter Expert / Team Lead. But now I am a Frontend developer and enjoying every bit of it. Have learnt a lot but there is a lot I still got to learn.

About this blog :

This blog is my attempt to share my two bits with the world. I will share things the way I understand them. While I will try to post as many tech posts as I can donâ€™t be surprised if you find more cake photos than real posts, ya I love food!

_There is always something new to learn!_

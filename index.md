Hi, I am **Alfred D'Souza**.

Started of as a computer teacher. Moved to a BPO/ITO, started there as Tech Support agent, got promoted as an Subject Matter Expert, finally got promoted as a Team Lead. Wanted to do something on my own, so tried my hands at business/startup failed. With nothing to do started brushing up HTML/CSS/jQuery and entered into IT. Enjoying every bit of it. Have learnt a lot but there is a lot I still got to learn.

About this blog :

This blog is an attempt to share my two bits with the world. I will share things the way I understand them. While I will try and post as many tech posts as I can donâ€™t be surprised if you find more cake photos then actual posts, ya I love food!

_There is always something new to learn!_
